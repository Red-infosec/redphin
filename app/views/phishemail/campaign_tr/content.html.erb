        <strong> Dear <%= @mark.display_name %> </strong>,

        <p>
          Our records indicate that you recently attempted to complete the companyâ€™s required online security training course.
        </p>

        <p>
          At this time we are missing some information which is required to certify the completion of your training,
          and have put your certification status on hold until the issue is resolved.
        </p>

        <p>
          To resolve the issue, please access the training portal (link below). Once you provide the requested information on the training portal,
          the training certification will be complete. Please do not reply to this email, as it is from an unmonitored mail box.
        </p>
