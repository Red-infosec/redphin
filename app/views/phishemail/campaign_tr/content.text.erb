Dear <%= @mark.display_name %>,

Our records indicate that you recently attempted to complete the companyâs
required online security training course.

At this time we are missing some information which is required to certify the
completion of your training, and have put your certification status on hold until
the issue is resolved.

To resolve the issue, please access the training portal (link below). Once you
provide the requested information on the training portal, the training
certification will be complete. Please do not reply to this email, as it is from
an unmonitored mail box.
